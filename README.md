# Adam-Neural-Network

In this repository, you will find the pre-trained model "ModelAndScale.pickle", the dataset containing 145,460 Australian weather observation "weatherAUS.csv", and the code for training and testing the model in the script file "NN_Adam.py". To run the "NN_Adam.py" script, you will need to have the following libraries installed on your computer: pickle, pandas, numpy, json, random, math, matplotlib, seaborn, tracemalloc, and time.
To view my final results you need to run the provided “NN_Adam.py” without doing any changes to the script with the pre-trained model called “ModelAndScale.pickle” and the dataset “weatherAUS.csv” in the same directory of the script, this will split the data in the same way that it was split during training, the script will then load the pre-trained model and create a classification report for the testing and training datasets, this will also plot the historic error and accuracy that the model had during training.
To reproduce my results by retraining the model, you need to uncomment the trainAndScore() function in the script.
Doing this will train, score, and save the model with 75% of the data for training, 2 hidden nodes, batch size of 16, learning rate of 1/10000, and 90 epochs. The model will be saved with the name "ModelAndScale.pickle" in the same directory where the script is located. Beware that if you train a new model and the pre-trained model of the same name is also in the same directory, the old pre- trained model will be replaced by the new model.
